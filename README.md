# TCR Clonotype Analysis from Single-Cell RNA-seq

This project analyzes T cell receptor (TCR) sequences from single-cell RNA-seq data using output from the Cell Ranger V(D)J pipeline. It identifies clonally expanded T cells and integrates this information with transcriptomic data for downstream visualization and interpretation.

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

This analysis aims to characterize T cell clonal diversity by parsing V(D)J sequencing results and integrating them with scRNA-seq data. The input comes from the `all_contig_annotations.csv` file generated by the Cell Ranger VDJ pipeline. TCR alpha (TRA), beta (TRB), and paired alpha-beta (TRAB) chains are extracted, saved, and annotated for each cell barcode.

After integration with Seurat RNA data, cells are categorized as:
- **no_TCR**: cells with no detected TCR  
- **unique_TCR**: cells with a private (non-shared) clonotype  
- **clonal_TCR**: cells that share the same clonotype (expanded clones)

UMAP plots are used to visualize these clonotype categories across the transcriptomic landscape.

## ðŸ“Š Analysis Tasks

### **Task 1: Parsing and Saving TCR Chain Information**
- Read `all_contig_annotations.csv` from Cell Ranger output
- Filter and separate entries into:
  - TRA (alpha)
  - TRB (beta)
  - TRAB (paired chains)
- Save cleaned clonotype assignments for downstream integration

### **Task 2: Integration with Seurat and Visualization**
- Load Seurat RNA-based object
- Add TCR clonotype information to cell metadata
- Categorize cells into: no_TCR, unique_TCR, and clonal_TCR
- Visualize clonotype categories on UMAP (e.g., `group.by = "clonotype_status"`)

## ðŸ’¡ Notes

- Raw data is not publicly available due to client ownership and confidentiality.
- Some example outputs plots are organized by task in the `output/` folder.
- This project is designed for both reproducibility and clarity.
